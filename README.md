# Flask on Predix
A codebook demonstrating details for pushing a Flask app on to Predix.

Prerequisites: \
To get the most from this codebook:

- You must have some prior experience writing Python applications and have mastery of
concepts of packages, modules, functions, decorators and object oriented programming.

- You must be knowledgeable of web development. Understanding of HTTP query and response
patterns and RESTful style architecture is assumed. 

- You must have a Predix account, installed the CLI and familiarized yourself with 
Cloud Foundry concepts for packaging, pushing and operating an app in the Predix cloud
environment. 

- You should have an introductory understanding of 
the Flask web development framework. If you have a copy of Miguel Grinberg's text and
studied one of his YouTube videos, that will suffice.  

### Release History
v5.0 - Add configuration templates and implement UAA authentication

v4.1 - Migrate schema, implement resource to POST and GET data

v4.0 - Bind to Predix Postgres Database service

v3.0 - Turn toy into production with Gunicorn WSGI server

v2.0 - Implement a Restful API as simply as possible, still using Flask Web Server (toy)

v1.0 - Simplest (toy) Flask application possible on Predix

#### Release v5.0
Add configuration templates and implement UAA authentication.

Template files now exist to remove app-specific details required for deployment. Running **create_services.sh** will:
- Create cf services based on provided prefix.
- Copy \*-template.\* files to new files without -template suffix.
- Replace placeholders with actual names of services and apps.
Implement UAA authentication
- Allows login using **app_user_1** for both the username and password.
- Add /login and /logout routes to /auth api.
- Requires login before accessing any route.

Notes
- gunicorn workers are explicitly set to 1 due to issues with UAA authentication and synchronous sessions

Steps:
1. Run `./create_services.sh`
2. Import Postman collections and environments to test all API calls.
3. Test locally with `python manage.py db upgrade && gunicorn manage:app --workers=1`
4. View in browser or use **Postman Requests**:
 - Import **flask_on_predix.postman_collection.json** using Import button.
 - Import **flask_on_predix_local.json** and **flask_on_predix_prod.json** using Manage Environments > Import.
 - Select **flask_on_predix (local)** as environment.
 - Use **Logout** request first to create a session.
 - Use **Login** request to store access token.
 - Import data using **Insert Data** request.
 - Query data using **Query Data** request.
 - To test in predix, swtch to **flask_on_predix (predix)**.

#### Release v4.1
Migrate schema, implement resource to POST and GET data.

Implement Flask-SQLAlchemy migration support. See Flask-migrations doc.
There are three steps: 
- Define SQLAlchemy models in app/models.py.
- Create migrations from models. \
`$python manage.py db init` creates the migrations folder and machinery. 
Run at dev time, outside of the app. \
`$python manage.py db migrate` populates migrations folder to be applied at app start time.
- Apply migrations to the database. \
`$python manage.py db upgrade` runs before app startup. Incorporate in Procfile web server
startup command line.


#### Release v4.0
Bind to Predix Postgres Database service.

Change the response of the API/V1.0/ index route to send back the
URI of the Postgres Service instance. The app depends on the service
being already started and running before the app is deployed and started.

Implement logging and stream log events to `STDOUT` so they can be captured by
Cloud Foundry.  Developers may inspect the log as a debugging aid.

`$cf logs <your app name> --recent`
  
Import and apply Python's ORM package SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy to 
provide pythonic access to the database service.

Include the Python Postgres Driver `psycopg2` to manage tha actual database 
protocol binding.

Implement `get_postgres_bindings()` to interrogate CF environment 
configuration and harvest identifying information, namely the 
URI, of the Postgres service. 

#### Release v3.0
Turn toy into production with Gunicorn WSGI server.

Getting the app production ready is as simple as installing the gunicorn
package into your local environment and fixing up the run calls in the
manifest and proc files.

To get the response for the query endpoint you must assemble 
the URI from the URI provided by CF when it starts your app. It'll
be on the terminal console.

`https://<hostname and domain>/api/v1.0/` 

returns

`{
  "hello": "world"
}`

#### Release v2.0
Implement a Restful API as simply as possible, still using Flask Web Server (toy).

This release is a minimal implementation of Flask Blueprints. The "App" is the
simplest Restful API we could write. It has one route, the index, that responds
with a string of HTML text.  The goal is to have a minimal architecture seed for
our Flask apps.

The crux of the implementation is in the package constructors, `__init__.py`.
The module `manage.py` holds a global reference to the Flask app. It implements commands run
outside the app. Like `app.run()`!  This pattern seperates concerns of app initializion
from app operations.

App startup depends on `FLASK_CONFIG` set in the application's user environment.
The config options are in `config.py`. The script `setcf.sh` can be used to set the variable. If you're pushing the app
for the fist time, suggest using --no-start option.

`$cf push --no-start -b <link to buildpack>`

`$source setcf.sh`

`$cf start <app name>`

#### Release v1.0
Simplest (toy) Flask application possible on Predix.

If you're a Python dev using Flask as your web framework, this release is useful for smoke testing local Cloud Foundry (CF) configuration 
and getting your feet wet with CF deployment commands.

Replace the name (k2dark) in `manifest.yml` with your own.

The Predix Cloud Foundry instance is equipped with a default
python buildback. See it referenced in `manifest.yml`. 
You will want to investigate which versions
of Python it supports at present. We've found it convenient to 
apply the latest buildpack from the CloudFoundry github repo
to configure our app with later versions of Python 3.x.
Here's the technique:

`$ cf push -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-python.git`

You will need to set the python version spec in `runtime.txt` to match your own. 
The syntax is fiddly. If you direct the output of `$python --version` to `runtime.txt`, it'll be malformed. 
You'll get something like "Python 3.6.0". The buildpack demands
python-3.6.0. If CF deployment barks at you about MISSING-MANIFEST-DEPENDENCY 
it maybe the spec in runtime.txt.

CloudFoundry will issue your app a port to listen for requests on.
It's set in the PORT enviroment variable during app startup in CF.
Note in the `flask_app.py` how we're picking it out of the environment. When you
run the app locally on your desktop it should listen on localhost (127.0.0.1)
with the port you specify for your local machine, 4999 in our case. When running on
Predix, CF manages your host, domain and port (and a lot more).
The app.run command in flask_app.py is setting the host to 0.0.0.0 configuring the app
to listen on all IP addresses. CF deals with the routing. Route config is a bit fiddly, and since
configuration is rare activity for most developers, it's worth taking your time 
to work out how the app is configured differently for dev and production environements.
